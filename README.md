# ABC-Fuzzy-string
The project of ABC
Our team will research various string matching solutions and perform testing to find the optimal solution for the branch. We will research various fuzzy string matching techniques, including those using machine learning and AI, develop an automated synthetic test case generator using Python/Pandas, determine the optimal technique, and tune the parameters of the algorithm(s) to optimize effectiveness and efficiency.
