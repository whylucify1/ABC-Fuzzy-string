# Fuzzy String Matching Practicum - Agricultural Bank of China, NY

Under the U.S. Government and Department of Treasury, any U.S. citizen or entity cannot transact with any individuals, firms, or countries on the OFAC (Office of Foreign Assets Control) sanctions list. Violators will be punished financially. Therefore, if the transactions which violated the regulation were completed by one specific bank, the bank would be punished with a large fine or even a lawsuit as well. Consequently, our mission is to provide our clients with substantial test case names using fuzzy name matching and complete a classification machine learning model to prevent those violations.
